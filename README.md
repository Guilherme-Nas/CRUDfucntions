# CRUDfucntions
CRUD made using functions.

First there is 3 documents, the one called banco.sql is the SQL to create a sample database to use in the project. The document called conexao.php is where the connection with the database is made. And last there is the index.php which is the index of the website where you get redirected to the other 3 pages with the tables from the database.

The following 3 folders are where the pages and the CRUD for each table in the database is located, there is also a funcoes.php in each folder where the functions that are being called from the other documents are located. 

OBS: listar.php in each of the tables folder is where the pages to each table can be found, including the css and forms that sen the variables through POST to the functions in funcoes.php.
